# TheWeatherDashboard (Sample README)
  ## Description
  The application uses OpenWeatherMap's server-side Weather API to retrieve current and forecasted weather conditions for the relevant city. In more detail, the application uses a combination of Javascript and HTML to allow user input and fetch data from the server based on it. The application's front-end is styled using a combination of CSS stylesheets and Bootstrap frameworks. Within Javascript, the fetch method is used to convert the user's city input into specified coordinates, which are fed into OpenWeatherMap's OneCall API. The Javascript dynamically displays this data to the dashboard, providing the user with the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the current UV index.

  <a name="usage"></a>

  ## Usage
  In order to use this application, please enter a city name in the search bar presented when the application is first opened. The city name must be entered in the format 'City, Country Code' (e.g. 'Toronto, CA). You are also able to enter just the city name (e.g. 'Toronto'). However, please be aware that if that city name exists in multiple countries, you will be provided with the most common result (e.g. if you enter 'London', you will be presented with weather information for London, GB - to retrieve weather data for London, Canada, please enter 'London, CA'). After you have chosen a city name, please click the 'Let's Go' button, after which you will see the current weather information and the five-day forecast. To see your previous searches, please see the 'Search History' section, from where you will be able to easily revisit the data for a city you had previously searched for by clicking the dynamically generated button for that search. Hovering over each weather section will highlight that section of the display in a different color to allow you to focus on that section.
