# TheProfessionalREADMEGenerator
## Description
When creating a project on GitHub, it is extremely important to have a high-quality README for the application, which provides details such as what the app is for, how to use it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. TheProfessionalREADMEGenerator is focused on minimizing the time spent on this aspect of a project by automating its creation. This is a command-line application, which will present you with multiple prompts. Once the prompts are answered, it will dynamically create a README.md file based on user inputs, so that you, a time-constrained developer, can devote more time to the actual project! <br/>
